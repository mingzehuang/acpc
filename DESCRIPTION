Description: The R package `acpc` implements robust PCA, then sparse PCA, then K-means classification for Micro-level census data. The original idea was inspired by
             [Vickers D. and Phil R. (2007). "Creating the UK National Statistics 2001 output area classification". *J. R. Statist. Soc. A*] and several similar assignments by [Irina Gaynanova] when I'm taking Statistical Computation at Texas A&M University as a graduate student.
